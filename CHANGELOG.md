# Changelog

All notable changes to Atomic Site land here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Admin write rate limiter** (`AdminWriteRateLimit` middleware,
  `internal/middleware/admin_writes.go`). Per-(user, peer-IP) token
  bucket: 60 writes/min sustained, 20-burst, returns 429 with
  `Retry-After`. Mounts after auth on the admin route group; reads,
  HEAD, and OPTIONS bypass. Closes the gap between the login limiter
  (which only catches credential brute force) and the actual write
  surface a logged-in attacker or compromised session would target.
- **RSS / Atom feeds for collections.** Each Collection whose
  `schema_org_type` is article-like (BlogPosting, NewsArticle,
  Article, etc.) auto-emits `public/{collection.slug}/feed.xml` at
  build time. Explicit `feed_enabled` / `feed_title` /
  `feed_description` / `feed_max_entries` overrides via the existing
  `settings_json`. Atom 1.0 (RFC 4287) over RSS 2.0 for the spec
  rigor; encoding/xml escapes hostile input. Drafts excluded;
  ordered by `published_at` DESC; capped at 50 entries by default.
- **Audit log retention sweep.** `audit_log` rows older than the
  configured window (`ATOMICSITE_AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, default
  365 days, clamped to [7, 3650]) drop in the existing daily
  retention manager. Counts surface in the per-sweep `SweepResult`
  exposed via `/api/admin/metrics`. Closes the
  log-grows-forever gap on the GDPR / ISO 27001 proof-of-controls
  table.
- **MFA enrollment policy.** New `ATOMICSITE_REQUIRE_MFA` env var:
  `""` (optional, default), `"admin"` (admins must enroll),
  `"all"` (every user must enroll). Login still issues a session
  cookie so the user can complete enrollment; the response carries
  `enroll_required: true`. The new `EnforceMFAEnrollment`
  middleware blocks state-changing routes for non-enrolled users
  with 403 + `error_code=mfa_enroll_required`, except the TOTP
  setup, change-password, and logout paths so the user can finish
  enrollment without getting stuck.
- **ZIP export of built site.** `GET
  /api/sites/{siteID}/dist.zip[?build_id=…]`. Streams the latest
  successful deployment's `dist/` tree as a ZIP archive. Symlink-
  aware path-traversal guard rejects entries that escape the dist
  root. Filename embeds the site slug, the deployment timestamp,
  and a 12-char prefix of the build ID. SiteAccess-gated;
  `build_id` is cross-tenant guarded so a guess from another site
  returns 404.
- New tests: `admin_writes_test.go` (8 cases), `feeds_test.go` (8
  cases), `audit_log_test.go` retention (4 cases),
  `mfa_enforce_test.go` (10 cases), `build_export_test.go` (8
  cases).
- New env vars documented in `.env.example`:
  `ATOMICSITE_TRUSTED_PROXIES`, `ATOMICSITE_REQUIRE_MFA`,
  `ATOMICSITE_AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`.

### Changed
- **OSS readiness sweep.** Removed every hardcoded reference to the
  internal SaaS host (`slab.example.com`) from
  production code. The custom-domain edge writer, the route reservation
  guard, and the screenshot tool's SSRF allow-list are now driven by
  `ATOMICSITE_PRIMARY_DOMAIN` + `BUILT_SITE_SUFFIX`. Loopback hosts
  always pass the screenshot allow-list so `make dev` works without any
  env vars.
- **Bcrypt cost standardised to 12.** `seedAdmin`, `resetPassword` CLI,
  `ChangePassword`, invite redemption, password reset, and TOTP
  recovery-code hashing all share `handlers.PasswordBcryptCost = 12`.
  Existing hashes verify normally; subsequent password changes upgrade
  to the new cost transparently.
- **TOTP recovery codes raised from 32 to 128 bits of entropy.**
  `recoveryCodeBytes` went from 4 to 16, so each generated code is now
  32 hex chars. Older 8-char codes still verify because
  `bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword` is length-agnostic; only newly minted
  enrollments use the longer format.
- **Custom trusted-proxy `RealIP` middleware** replaces
  `chi.middleware.RealIP`. `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` are honored
  only when the immediate TCP peer is in
  `ATOMICSITE_TRUSTED_PROXIES`. With the env var unset, the headers are
  ignored entirely so audit logs and rate limiters see the actual peer.
  This closes the audit-log spoofing vector when atomicsite is exposed
  directly to the internet.

### Fixed
- **verify-live worker honors cancellation.** In-flight progress writes
  (`UpdateVerifyJobProgress`, `CreateMigrationVerification`) now use the
  worker's cancellable context instead of `context.Background()`, so
  clicking Cancel actually halts further DB writes. The terminal
  `FinishVerifyJob` write stays on a fresh background context with a
  10s timeout so the cancelled job's terminal state row still lands.
- **Frontend type errors zeroed.** Resolved 16 svelte-check errors and
  2 warnings: dead `onValueChange` prop on the Bits-UI `Select` (member
  role-change was non-functional), `SubmitEvent`/`MouseEvent` mismatch
  on the Create-Invite button, possibly-undefined accesses on the
  per-tenant quotas page, and the `signup/[token]` route param type
  drift. `bunx svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json` reports a clean
  4650-file run.
- **Audit-log IP spoofing closed.** The two `auditClientIP`
  helpers (handlers + workspace middleware) used to read
  `X-Forwarded-For` / `CF-Connecting-IP` directly, bypassing the
  trusted-proxy gate added earlier in this release. Both now read
  only `r.RemoteAddr`, which `TrustedProxyRealIP` canonicalizes at
  the top of the request stack. Untrusted peers can no longer
  inject the audit log's `actor_ip` column.

### Tests
- Earlier in this release window: `screenshot_test.go` (7 cases
  locking the configurable SSRF allow-list), `realip_test.go` (9
  cases covering trusted-proxy XFF resolution, IPv6 round-trip,
  and untrusted-peer spoof prevention).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-08

First public release as Apache 2.0 open core.

### What's in this release

- **Single-binary admin server** (Go + chi + sqlc + SQLite) with an
  embedded SvelteKit SPA, Astro-based site builder, and `dist/` static
  output suitable for any host (VPS, Vercel, Netlify, R2, Cloudflare
  Pages, Dockyard, Kubernetes).
- **Agent-first content authoring**: HTTP + MCP surfaces with 78 tools
  spanning settings, blocks, pages, collections, knowledgebase,
  branding, builds, screenshots, and migrations.
- **CMS migration system** for sitemap, WordPress, Webflow, and Ghost
  sources, with URL planner, redirect porter, async verify-live worker
  (up to 25k URLs), 404 inbox, and one-click 301/302/307/308/410.
- **Conversion goals + identify** for first-party analytics. Per-site
  goals match by URL pattern, event name, or `form_submit`. Form
  submissions auto-identify the visitor when an email field is
  detected.
- **DuckDB-backed analytics** (read-only ATTACH on the live SQLite
  file) with retention sweeps that respect per-site
  `general.{analytics,consent,engagement}_retention_days` settings.
- **Embedded CookieProof widget** so consent gating works without a
  separate service.
- **Per-tenant quotas + workspace RBAC** (sites, pages, redirects,
  storage bytes, build minutes; owner/admin/editor roles).
- **Custom-domain reconciler** (nginx fragments + certbot HTTP-01 +
  optional Cloudflare zone helper) with verify probes and an
  operator-facing admin UI.
- **Admin SPA** covering content (pages, blocks, collections,
  knowledgebase, media), site (branding, fonts, settings, deploy
  targets, domains, allowed scripts), workflow (migrations, agent
  surface, MCP), and account (members, invites, MFA, billing for the
  EE / Cloud build).
- **A+ security defaults**: HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict
  session cookies, headers fragment for nginx, refuse-to-start on weak
  secrets in non-localhost deploys, SSRF guards in every fetch path,
  shield-tokenizer LLM boundary, audit log on every cross-workspace
  bypass.
- **Apache 2.0 open core**: cloud-only multi-tenant edge code lives
  behind the `ee` build tag.
