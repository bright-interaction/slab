Targets follow the design.fidelity dial: performance fidelity = A+ everywhere; balanced (default) = A+ where agent-writable; showcase = security/a11y/privacy >= A-, seo >= B, performance >= C+ (the operator traded speed for design; spend that budget on craft, read design_playbook.fidelity first).

Read slab://site/context first. The payload carries everything you need to plan: pending_setup (gaps), block_schemas (what each block_type expects), settings_catalog (every settable key + writable_by_agent flag, including design.fidelity), security_posture (admin-only items you can't touch), i18n (locale + hreflang strategy), endpoints (REST mirror of MCP).

Then converge on the perfect-score checklist below. Treat each item as a hard requirement before claiming done.

== Foundation ==
1. Profile completeness via update_profile: business_name, registration_nr, country, contact_email, privacy_email, security_email, address_line1, city, postal_code. Drives Organization JSON-LD + security.txt.
2. Branding via PATCH /api/agent/branding: meta_title (30-60 chars, fallback for any page without override), meta_description (120-160 chars with action verbs like "learn / try / get / book / läs / prova"), og_image_id (1200x630 from media library, brand folder), favicon_id (square PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP; SVG is rejected, use PNG), lang.
3. Settings via bulk_upsert_settings:
   - seo.canonical_base = absolute https URL of the production domain
   - seo.meta_title_template = "{page_title} {separator} {site_name}"
   - seo.meta_description_template = "{page_description}"
   - seo.same_as = newline-separated social URLs (LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, etc.; drives JSON-LD sameAs)
   - seo.sitemap_enabled = "1"
   - general.hreflang_strategy = "path" (default)
   - general.additional_langs = "en,sv,..." for every locale you'll publish
   - analytics.slab_tracking_enabled = "1"
   - analytics.cookieproof_enabled = "1" to ship the bundled, same-origin cookie banner; branding colors flow in automatically. Banner copy + categories live in cookie_banner_title/_description/_position, cookie_banner_accept/_reject/_customize, cookie_cat_analytics/_marketing/_preferences. Per-cookie metadata (Cookie/Provider/Purpose/Expiry table in the extended modal) lives in cookie_declarations as a JSON array; presets for enabled trackers (GA4, language) auto-populate, user entries override on (category, name) collision.
   - Compliance + UX knobs (added 2026-05-01): cookie_expiry_days (0..365, default 365 — IMY caps at 12 months), cookie_revision (int — bump to invalidate prior consent on policy change), cookie_theme (light/dark/auto), cookie_floating_trigger (left/right/off), cookie_language_selector (0/1), ccpa_enabled (0/1) + ccpa_url (CCPA Do-Not-Sell link, required when ccpa_enabled=1).
   - Reject button always shares Accept's color (IMY 2026 equal-prominence guardrail). The consent cookie name is fixed to "as_consent" — not configurable per site.

== Structure ==
4. URL convention: pick one. Either root = default lang (e.g. / + /sv/, the typical Swedish-marketing pattern) OR symmetric (/en/ + /sv/ + a noindex splash at /). Don't mix. Hreflang emission is path-based on actually-published page slugs.
5. For every page you publish, set BOTH meta_title and meta_description on the page row via update_page (don't rely on branding fallback alone — eval flags pages with empty per-page meta on title-length / description-length checks).
6. Set no_index=0 on real content pages. The splash page should be no_index=1 + hide_global_blocks=1.
7. Each locale needs a counterpart for hreflang to emit cleanly: /en/about ↔ /sv/about, /en/privacy ↔ /sv/privacy, /en/404 ↔ /sv/404. If a counterpart is missing, eval flags the multi-language pages.

== Pages ==
8. Every content page (not splash) needs at minimum:
   - 1 hero block at sort_order=0 with: eyebrow (optional), headline (becomes h1, REQUIRED for eval Has H1), subheading, cta_text + cta_url, optional secondary_label + secondary_url, optional image_id from media library
   - 1+ feature_grid OR text block carrying real content (300+ words across the page total — eval flags pages under 300 words)
   - 1 cta block at the end with heading, text, cta_text, cta_url
9. Use feature_grid for cards (each item: title, body, icon Lucide name like Mail/Server/Lock/Workflow). 3-6 items renders cleanly.
10. Use text blocks for long-form prose. Multi-paragraph by separating with blank lines (\n\n); single \n inside a paragraph becomes <br>.
11. Don't use raw HTML blocks unless absolutely necessary; the forbidden_patterns guardrail rejects <iframe> and inline scripts.
12. No plaintext emails in block text — eval flags them as info. Use mailto: via raw HTML carefully OR refer to a contact page that uses an obfuscated address pattern.

== Global blocks ==
13. PUT /api/agent/global/header with name, block_type=header, data.links = primary nav + lang switcher + booking CTA (last link auto-styled as a primary pill).
14. PUT /api/agent/global/footer with name, block_type=footer, data.copyright + data.links pointing at /<lang>/privacy, /<lang>/terms, /<lang>/cookies, plus social URLs.

== Build verb is publish verb ==
15. trigger_build = "build static Astro output + run eval engine + auto-deploy via the configured deploy target (Dockyard, rsync, local bind mount, Vercel, Fly, or any static host)". After it returns success, the live site reflects the new content.
16. After every build, get_evaluation(build_id) returns 5 categories: accessibility (33pt), performance (12pt), privacy (14pt), security (26pt), seo (64pt). Walk failing checks, fix, re-build. Iterate until the categories you can write are above 95%.

== Block-time guardrails ==
17. Generic alt text ("image", "photo") is rejected at create_block / update_block time.
18. Empty meta_description, missing CTA verbs, slug with underscores or trailing slash are all rejected at update_page time.
19. Personalization conditions (data.condition) are validated against a small DSL; complex booleans rejected.

== Admin-only items you can't fix ==
The eval will flag these but you can't write them:
- security category settings (HSTS preload, CSP extra directives, COOP/CORP/COEP, X-Frame-Options): admin only at human_admin_url shown in settings_catalog.
- allowed-scripts (CSP allowlist for cal.com, YouTube, etc.): admin only.
- Subresource Integrity: requires layout-level SHA-384 fetch.
- Focus Indicators: requires layout-level :focus-visible CSS.
- Resource Hints: requires layout-level <link rel=preconnect> for fonts.
- Modern Image Formats: hero/image renderer doesn't yet pick WebP variants from media.variants_json.
- Image dimensions on hero: renderer doesn't emit width/height (yet).

For these, surface them to the human at the end with the exact admin URL each one points at. Don't loop trying to write them — bulk_upsert_settings rejects them with rejected_admin_only.

== Verification gate ==
Before claiming the site is "done":
- list_pages returns every page you intended.
- list_blocks for the home page returns 5+ blocks in order (sort_order increasing).
- get_site_context's pending_setup list is empty (or only admin-only items remain).
- get_evaluation shows 95%+ on agent-writable categories.
- The live URL serves correctly: curl -I returns 200, the HTML contains <h1> from the hero block, OG meta tags reference /media/<og_image_id>, headers carry HSTS + CSP.

Drive end-to-end now. Ask me only when you genuinely need a value (org-nr, social URL, copy direction); otherwise pick sensible defaults from the brand voice and keep moving.`}},
