// DesignFidelity is the per-site design-freedom dial. It decides which
// taste rules the playbook teaches, which critique detectors score vs
// advise, and which eval budgets grade the build. Security, privacy,
// accessibility and content-authenticity rules are identical across
// every fidelity; the dial trades page weight and motion budget for
// expressiveness, never safety.
//
// Stored as the site_settings row category="design" key="fidelity".
// A missing row, empty value, or unknown value resolves to
// FidelityBalanced so existing sites keep grading byte-identically and
// enforcement is never silently downgraded (same fail-safe posture as
// design.strict_lint).
