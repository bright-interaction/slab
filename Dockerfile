# Slab Dockerfile (self-contained).
#
# Builds entirely from the slab/ directory. The CookieProof widget
# bundle is vendored at internal/builder/assets/cookieproof.embed.esm.js
# and embedded into the Go binary via go:embed (see widget_embed.go), so
# Slab has zero runtime or build-time dependency on the sibling
# CookieProof source. To refresh the widget bundle from source, run a
# CookieProof build separately and commit the regenerated asset.
#
# Local build (from the repo root):
#   docker build -f Dockerfile -t slab .

# Stage 1: SvelteKit admin SPA.

#
# CGO note: the analyticsdb package uses marcboeker/go-duckdb/v2 which
# requires CGO + libduckdb. duckdb-go-bindings 0.1.21+ links against
# `backtrace`, `backtrace_symbols`, and `malloc_trim`. Backtrace ships
# in glibc (and on alpine via libexecinfo, removed in alpine 3.17+) and
# malloc_trim is glibc-only. Building against musl fails to link, so
# this stage uses the debian-based golang image. The runtime stage
# stays alpine; the binary is statically linked (CGO is wrapped in a
# musl-compatible-via-glibc-static build via -ldflags + go's default
# external linker pulling in libduckdb statically). We force pure
# external linking with -extldflags '-static' so the produced binary
# can run on alpine 3.20 without dragging glibc.

# Phase 30.4: Litestream for continuous SQLite WAL replication to

# of 2026-05-06; bump when upstream cuts a new release. The binary
# is statically linked, ~25MB, no runtime deps.
